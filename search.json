The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg. A transverse incision was made over the dorsal ganglion. Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.   The extensor tendon was then incised, dissected, and retracted out of the operative field. The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised. Care was taken to protect ligament integrity. The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position. The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.
