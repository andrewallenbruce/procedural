ICD-10-PCS Fundamentals ICD-10-PCS designed developed adhere recommendations made National Committee Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS). also incorporates input wide range organizations, individual physicians, healthcare professionals, researchers. Several structural attributes recommended new procedure coding system. attributes include following: Multiaxial structure Completeness Expandability Multiaxial structure key attribute provides framework structural attributes multiaxial code structure. Multiaxial code structure makes possible ICD-10-PCS complete, expandable, provide high degree flexibility functionality. CODING TIP Multiaxial refers “one axis” developing single line. ICD-10-PCS codes composed seven characters. character can considered axis. Thus, structure code “multiaxial.” character represents category information can specified procedure performed. character defines category information physical position code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Section Body System Root Operation Body Part Approach Device Qualifier character’s position can understood semi-independent axis classification allows different specific values inserted space, whose physical position remains stable. Within defined code range, character retains general meaning confers value position. example, 5th character retains general meaning “approach” sections 0-4 7-9 system. specific value 5th character define specific approach, Open. group values character contains valid choices relation characters code, giving system completeness. 5th character, example, significantly distinct approach assigned approach value applicable approach values included represent possible versions procedure. group values character can added needed, giving system expandability. significantly new distinct approach used perform procedures, new approach value can added system upcoming years. group values confined character, giving ICD-10-PCS stable, predictable readability across wide range codes. sections 0-4 7-9 system, example, 5th character always represents approach. ICD-10-PCS’ multiaxial structure houses capacity completeness, expandability, flexibility, giving high degree functionality multiple uses. Completeness Completeness considered key structural attribute new procedure coding system. specific recommendation completeness includes characteristics: unique code available significantly different procedure. code retains unique definition. Codes reused. unique code can constructed every significantly different procedure. vastly enhances data capturing process. Within section, character defines consistent component code, contains applicable values character. values define individual expressions (open, percutaneous) character’s general meaning (approach) used construct unique procedure codes. approaches procedure performed assigned separate approach value system, every procedure uses different approach unique code. true characters well. procedure performed different body part unique code; procedure performed using different device unique code; . Unique Definitions ICD-10-PCS codes constructed individual values rather lists fixed codes text descriptions, unique, stable definition code system retained.
